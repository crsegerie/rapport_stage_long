## Usage

## Inspiration

At the time of writing my IDD thesis, I found a very good LaTeX [template](https://github.com/sdasrc/thesis-template-iitbhu). It had a minor problem though.

Being a modified version of a Cambridge University's thesis template, and the complexities of the original template, I found it hard to navigate through and make custom design changes in it.

This inspired me to write this minimalistic thesis template for IIT (BHU) Varanasi from scratch.
